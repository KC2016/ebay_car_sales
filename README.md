I explore a dataset of used cars from [eBay-Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/), a classifieds section of the German eBay website.This analysis aims to gather some insights into the brands and popularity of listed cars, then understand relation among caracthersistics and price. As well as, to found best weekday/monthday to post the ad and to expect more seen based on previous data.

### What was done?

- Cleaning
- Removing outliers
- Fixing data types
- Exploring price in function of brands and vehicle types


## Folders
- Data: dataset in `.csv`
- Images: pictures in `.png`
- Code: notebooks in Python saved as `.ipynb`

## Setup

The code was made and run in the DataQuest platform using:
- Jupyter Notebook
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)

# The Dataset
The original dataset had over 370.000 records of used cars scraped with Scrapy from eBay-Kleinanzeigen and was available in Kaggle. DataQuest pre-prepared the dataset reduzing to 50.000 entries and provides it.
